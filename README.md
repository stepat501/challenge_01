- Why did you build this project? 
I built this project to improve the accessibility standards so that the site is more optimized for search engines. 
- What problem does it solve? 
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
- What did you learn?
I learnt that by using Semantic elements as opposed to non-semantic in code, it helps the the code reader make more sense of the layout. I also learnt that by using Semantic elements it promotes Web Accessibility for users.
